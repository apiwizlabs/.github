<b>APIwiz is a vendor offering a centralized control plane for API management. It establishes the
APIOps necessary for API programs to build consumable APIs and equip them for monetization,
allowing business and technical stakeholders to participate, communicate, and collaborate with
low-code, automation, and embedded governance shifted left across planning, designing,
building, managing, testing, securing, publishing and monitoring APIs. Its federated gateway
capabilities allow it to integrate with any API gateway. It also provides real-time intelligence into
API usage, performance, compliance, and workflow visualizations without resorting to external
tools.</b>
